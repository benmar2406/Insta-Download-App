# Insta-Download-App
Use this app made with Python, mainly Selenium, to download the text and image content of the saved posts in a specific instagram collection in your account.

The app logs in into your account and downloads the texts and images of the posts and saves them into a word document locally.

The login will only work with the german version. For other languages small adjustments need to be done for the login part.
